+ 3D Tic Tac Toe +

Currently can only play against humans.
To play, run TICTACTO.

Ok, here's how it works:

 _\_\_
  _\_\_	There are 3 grids, one on top of the other.
    \ \
 _\_\_	To win, just get a line of 3, in any direction:
  _\_\_	sideways, diagonal from one corner to the other,
    \ \	same place in all 3 levels, etc.
 _\_\_
  _\_\_	There is no move checking, so be sure to check
    \ \	for yourself if you or your friend won.

Limitations:
No move checking, as stated above
Any other shortcomings?

Improvements will be attempted on demand:
	3D grid
	move checking
	AI?
